        <p>
            Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination [related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

            If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizer may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event and the Meetup group. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the organizer immediately.
