                <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                Nested views and state management are the killer features that UI-Router provides for people who find Angular's built in ngRoute too limiting. Learn the basics of integrating UI-Router into your application and see how easy it is to transition between states.

He spent most of his career in Java before venturing into Ruby, JavaScript and NodeJS to see if the grass is really greener on the other side.

                <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                Angular and Ember, along with Backbone, are the most popular JavaScript MV* frameworks, yet they couldn't be more different in how they are used to build apps. Take a walk for an evening into the Ember world. First we will explore how to build an app in Ember then we will compare and contrast it to how it is done in Angular. It should be a fun and educational evening.

                Troy, aka the Rockncoder, currently has fun writing full stack code with ASP.NET MVC or Node.js on the back-end and web or mobile up front. He started coding over 30 years ago, cutting his teeth writing games for C64, Apple II, and IBM PCs. After burning out he moved on to Windows system programming before catching Internet fever just before the dot net bubble burst. After realizing that mobile devices were the perfect window into back-end data, he added mobile programming to his repertoire. He loves competing in hackathons and randomly posting interesting code nuggets on his blog: <a href="http://therockncoder.blogspot.com">therockncoder.blogspot.com</a>

            <p>
                <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                Simply put, D3 is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data that allows you to bring data to life using HTML, CSS, and SVG. Its emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers, and its combination of powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation allows for some awesome data visualizations.
                <br/><br/>
                This talk is primarily a code-oriented presentation that will focus on some D3 fundamentals, which will include useful data visualizations with transitions and animations, integration with Angular, and making them mobile-friendly.

            <p>
                <strong>Abstract:</strong>
                One of the major components of AngularJS is the digest loop, which makes features like data binding and
                model watching possible. Understanding how the digest loop works help you avoid many performance
                pitfalls and bugs in your applications. This presentation examines the digest loop in details and
                explores how other features are built on top of it.

                CoffeeScript and TypeScript. Before catching the JS bug, he worked primarily with Java and .NET and

                As a software developer since 1989, I have seen many technologies come and go (and have dabbled in just
                about everything). The current state of software development is as exciting as ever! With the advent of
                web applications, the industry is growing at a rapid pace – keeping up with everything is a job all by
                itself.

                The browser is the ultimate development platform and I'm fortunate to develop with the most exciting
                technologies. I've worked in companies big and small in different industries to push my ability
                to engineer the best solutions. I'm passionate about bringing people together into a kick-ass community
                and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-OC/" target="_blank">AngularJS-OC</a> is a result of that.
                Innovation and engagement shouldn't be limited to tech geeks, though. Help me organize
                <a href="http://www.meetup.com/codeforoc/">Code for America Brigade</a> in OC to promote the same values
                that are so important in open source!

                <strong>Abstract:</strong> HTML enhancements for web apps! AngularJS is a JavaScript framework for
                building
                rich,
                complex and maintainable web applications. It is fully extensible and works well with other libraries.
                AngularJS
                has support for client side routing, data binding, RESTful sever communication and more. AngularJS also
                lets you
                extend HTML vocabulary for your applications. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive,
                readable,
                and quick to develop.</p>

            <p>
                In this presentation, we’ll introduce you to AngularJS. We’ll start with a new web application and build
                a
                sample app to highlight some of the features in AngularJS. We will build a RESTful endpoint using
                <strong>Node
                    JS</strong> to
                easily persist data back to the server. This will be a code heavy talk with lots of examples. We’ll look
                at
                various features of the framework including support for data binding, client side routing, services,
                filters and
                dependency injection. This presentation will give you an introduction to AngularJS and some tips for
                creating
                complex and maintainable front-end web applications.
