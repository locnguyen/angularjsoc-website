    <p>
      The <strong><a href="{{social.meetup}}" target="_blank">AngularJS OC</a></strong> meetup was started in
      July 2013 to serve AngularJS enthusiasts in Orange County. At the time there was already a group that met
      in Los Angeles. Southern Californians know that might as well be Canada with the distance and traffic separating
      our geographies.

      The explosion of <a href="http://todomvc.com" target="_blank">MVC frameworks</a> in the web development community
      might lead to a paradox of choice. Make your life simple by reducing your choice to just AngularJS. Organize
      your code and iterate faster. Learn what some are already calling "HTML6".

      The awesomeness of our young meetup is due to volunteers who lend their time and talent. Can you
      <strong><a href="/getinvolved">help</a></strong>?
